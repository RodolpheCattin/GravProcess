# GravProcess 1.3

Relative gravimeters are extensively used in numerous geosciences applications. This software developed by R. Cattin and S. Mazzotti is dedicated to computing high-resolution data associated with complex gravity survey. It is an open source code using the MATLABTM language. It is designed to be easily accessible for users with no prior knowledge of MATLABTM .

- A description of the algorithms and an example of processing can be found in Cattin et al. (2015), (PDF).
